# Response Parsing (JavaScript)

A JavaScript port of [Response Parsing (Python)](https://github.com/BM345/ResponseParsingPython) for use with SCORM files.

This port of the code maintains parity with the Python version - i.e., features in v1.4 of the Python version also exist in v1.4 of the JavaScript version.
