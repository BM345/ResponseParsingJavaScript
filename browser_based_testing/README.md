# Browser-Based Testing

This part of the repository contains a web app, through which you can interact with the validation code.

The web app consists of a text box for the student's answer, and various other inputs to set the constraints on the answer.

Type an answer into the main text box, set the constraints for that answer, and see if it would pass validation.

## How to use

```bash
cd browser_based_testing
python start_app.py
```

Then go to `localhost:8080/index.html` in a browser, and you'll be able to interact with the app.
